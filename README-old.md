### 🌟 Reputation, Trust & Compliance Infrastructure

At the heart of Web3Lancer is a robust, on-chain reputation and identity system:

- **💯 Transparent Ratings** - All reputation scores are calculated and stored on-chain, ensuring manipulation-proof reviews and trust metrics.
- **👥 Verified Reviews** - Only clients and freelancers who have worked together can submit reviews, guaranteed by blockchain verification and compliance logic.
- **⚖️ Dispute Resolution** - Fair arbitration process for contested reviews, with full transparency of decisions.
- **🔍 Reputation History** - Complete on-chain history of work quality and compliance that follows freelancers across projects.
- **🧮 Decentralized Scoring** - Reputation scores (0-5) calculated automatically by smart contracts, without central authority.
- **🛡️ Modular Identity** - Each user account is unique and verifiable, supporting Sybil resistance, access control, and fraud reduction, all without exposing personal data.
- **🔗 Permissioned Access** - Smart contracts and app features can adapt logic based on user trust profiles and compliance status.

The smart contract efficiently manages user reputation through functions like `submit_review`, `get_reputation_score`, and `dispute_review`, ensuring a trustworthy and compliant marketplace for all participants.

### 🔗 Advanced Trust Network Integration

Web3Lancer provides enhanced trust scoring and compliance verification:

- **🎯 Trust Score Analytics** - Advanced behavioral scoring and KYC verification integration
- **🛡️ Sybil Resistance** - "One User – One Account" policy enforcement through reputation-based validation
- **🔐 Compliance Filtering** - Smart contract access control based on user verification levels
- **⚡ Reputation-Based Logic** - Dynamic feature access and permissions tied to on-chain trust profiles

This enables sophisticated access control, fraud prevention, and compliance management while maintaining user privacy through zero-knowledge verification methods.
